JOIN Users ON Interactions.UserID =
Users.UserID
WHERE Interactions.ReactionType = 'Like'
GROUP BY Interactions.PostID,
Users.UserID,
Users.Username
ORDER BY Likes DESC;

    (π PostID, Likes, UserID, Username
        (γ PostID, UserID, Username;
            COUNT(∗)→Likes
            (σ ReactionType=′Like′
            (Interactions) ⨝ Users)
        )
